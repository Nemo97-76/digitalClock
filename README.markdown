# Digital Clock

A simple and elegant digital clock built with **React** and **Vite**. This project displays the current time in a clean, responsive interface, leveraging modern web development tools for fast development and performance.

## Features
- Real-time display of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- Minimalist UI with customizable styling.
- Built with React for component-based architecture.
- Powered by Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Tech Stack
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and HMR.
- **ESLint**: Configured for code quality and consistency.
- **CSS**: For styling the clock interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nemo97-76/digitalClock.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd digitalClock
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the digital clock in action.

### Building for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

### Linting
Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Customization
- **Styling**: Modify `src/index.css` or component-specific CSS to change the clock's appearance (e.g., fonts, colors, or animations).
- **Functionality**: Extend the `Clock` component in `src/components/` to add features like 12/24-hour format toggle or timezone support.

## ESLint Configuration
This project uses ESLint for code quality. To extend the configuration (e.g., for TypeScript):
1. Install TypeScript and type-aware lint rules:
   ```bash
   npm install typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin --save-dev
   ```
2. Update `.eslintrc.cjs` as described in the [Vite TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
